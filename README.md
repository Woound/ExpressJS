# ExpressJS / MongoDB x Mongoose
Mainly "clunky" programs to provide me with a reference for futue projects. Here, I am experimenting around with:
- Express JS: a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- EJS: A simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
- MongoDB: A general purpose NoSQL database.
- Mongoose: MongoDB object modeling for node.js.
